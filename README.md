# Addons-frontend ðŸ”¥

Front-end infrastructure and code to complement mozilla/addons-server

## Requirements

* Node 4.x LTS
* npm 3.x

The easiest way to manage multiple node versions in development is to use
nvm. See https://github.com/creationix/nvm for more info.

## Get started

* npm install
* npm run dev


## NPM scripts

| Script                 | Description                                       |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| npm start              |  Starts the express server                        |
| npm test               |  Runs the tests                                   |
| npm run build          |  Builds the lib                                   |
| npm run dev            |  Starts the dev server (Express + webpack)        |
| npm run dev:search     |  As above but just the search code                |
| npm run dev:disco      |  As above but just the discovery pane code        |
| npm run lint           |  Lints the files with `eslint` (Run in `npm test`)|
| npm run eslint         |  An alias for `npm run lint`                      |
| npm run jscs           |  Checks for style issues (Run in `npm test`)      |

## Overview and rationale

This project will hold several distinct front-ends e.g:

* Editors search tool
* Discovery Pane
* and beyond...

We've made a conscious decision to avoid "premature modularization" and
keep this all in one repository. This will help us build out the necessary
tooling to support a universal front-end infrastructure without having to
worry about cutting packages and bumping versions the entire time.

At a later date if we need to move things out into their own project we
still can.

## Core technologies

* Based on Redux + React
* Code written in ES2015+
* Universal rendering via node
* Unit tests with high coverage (aiming for 100%)
