# Internationalization (i18n)

We're using gettext for translations. All the actual translations are
carried out via [Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/).

Some commands wrap standard gettext tools. To run these commands you'll need
to ensure you have done the following steps:

* Run `npm install` to install all the project deps.
* Install [gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) tools for your
platform.
* Install podebug (see [Building the debug locales for more information](#build-the-debug-locales))

*NOTE: All the instructions below show `[MY_APP]` you should replace that with the
name of the app you are updating e.g. `NODE_APP_INSTANCE=disco bin/create-locales`*

## Adding a new language/locale

The supported languages are defined in the configuration. See
[`config/default.js`](https://bit.ly/1XScjwq) and look for the `langs` list.

Add the new language to the list and then run:

```
# create the locale for a newly added language.
NODE_APP_INSTANCE=[MY_APP] bin/create-locales
```

## Updating locales

These docs detail the steps needing to be run to extract newly added strings
and update the locales.

After running each process you will need to commit the changes and push a PR
to the addons-frontend repo.

### Extracting newly added strings

Strings extracted are those wrapped with `i18n.gettext()` or any other
function supported by Jed (the library we use in JavaScript to carry out
replacements for the string keys in the current locale).

The strings are extracted using a babel plugin via webpack. Extracted strings
are added to a pot template file. This file is used to seed the po for each
locale with the strings needing translating when merging locales.

To extract + merge new strings for an app in the addons-frontend project
you should run the following commands:

```
# First extract the new strings.
NODE_APP_INSTANCE=[MY_APP] bin/extract-locales
# Merge the new strings into the locale files.
NODE_APP_INSTANCE=[MY_APP] bin/merge-locales
```

### Building the debug locales

Using this command Generates a unicode debug locale and a flipped rtl debug
locale using [podebug](https://bit.ly/1r3yFy5).

`podebug` is required for this step, you can install it with:

 * OSX: `brew install translate-toolkit`
 * Debian Linux variants: `sudo apt-get install translate-toolkit`
 * For other platforms see the [podebug docs](https://bit.ly/1r3yFy5)

To build the debug locale files run:

```
# build the debug locale files.
NODE_APP_INSTANCE=[MY_APP] bin/debug-locales
```

### Building the JSON locale files

This command create the JSON files which are then built into JS bundles by
webpack when the build step is run.

Since dist files are created when needed you only need to build and commit
the JSON to the repo.

```
# build the JSON.
NODE_APP_INSTANCE=[MY_APP] bin/build-locales
```
